## About
Here is my portfolio website source code. I am updating it daily, adding new things. Below are some of the changes arranged by date.

I just recently started updating it, so the first update date is 24.3.2018.


**Update log:**
date: 24.3.2018
I already added the top rain effect code, there seems to be a bug in Chrome, it just kind of freezes on scrolling. When i have time i will look into it.

Done the menu styling, i am using flexbox. Perhaps in the future i will hide the menu behind a button on smaller
screen sizes, but for now i just change the font size and menu goes into a vertical position.

Also added the picture on the landing page, added some
styling to the text. Not really happy with the look will update it later on.

So far website has been tested in Chrome and Firefox,
seems fine so far, but in Edge there are some bugs will look into that later on as well.

date: 26.3.2018
Bug with rain effect:
Sometimes it doesn't load, need to refresh the page, must look into that.
Added content to about page and styling. Also body patter background.

date: 28.3.2018
Fixed the bug with the rain effect, on load sometimes it would be the full height of the div. Possible issues on mobile device, will check later on.
Fixed the nav bar not sticking at the right moment, just changed the first variable in if statment.
Some styling to the about page, not done anything about mobile device atm, will do later on.
