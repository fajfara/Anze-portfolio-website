Update log:
..* date: 24.3.2018
⋅⋅⋅ I already added the top rain effect code, there seems to ⋅⋅⋅ be a bug in Chrome, it just kind of freezes on scrolling. ⋅⋅⋅ When i have time i will look into it.

⋅⋅⋅ Done the menu styling, i am using flexbox. Perhaps in the ⋅⋅⋅ future i will hide the menu behind a button on smaller ⋅⋅⋅ screen sizes, but for now i just change the font size and ⋅⋅⋅ menu goes into a vertical position.

⋅⋅⋅ Also added the picture on the landing page, added some ⋅⋅⋅ styling to the text. Not really happy with the look will ⋅⋅⋅ update it later on.

⋅⋅⋅ So far website has been tested in Chrome and Firefox,  ⋅⋅⋅ seems fine so far, but in Edge there are some bugs will ⋅⋅⋅ look into that later on as well.
