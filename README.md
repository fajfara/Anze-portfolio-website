Update log:
..*date: 24.3.2018
⋅⋅⋅I already added the top rain effect code, there seems to ⋅⋅⋅be a bug in Chrome, it just kind of freezes on scrolling. ⋅⋅⋅When i have time i will look into it.

⋅⋅⋅Done the menu styling, i am using flexbox. Perhaps in the ⋅⋅⋅future i will hide the menu behind a button on smaller 
⋅⋅⋅screen sizes, but for now i just change the font size and ⋅⋅⋅menu goes into a vertical position.

⋅⋅⋅Also added the picture on the landing page, added some 
⋅⋅⋅styling to the text. Not really happy with the look will ⋅⋅⋅update it later on.

⋅⋅⋅So far website has been tested in Chrome and Firefox, 
⋅⋅⋅seems fine so far, but in Edge there are some bugs will ⋅⋅⋅look into that later on as well.
